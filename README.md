# Security Science

The field of Security Science has been around for many years but has been hidden away in a variety of processes and practices.  Today, however, it is essential in helping developers to make better decisions as they build and deploy software.  How?

Security scientists have a variety of information at their disposal which can help to reinforce good decisions.  In fact, if done right, security scientists can contribute decision models that help to measure and increase confidence in the security of software.  

We aim to make this project a collection of security artifacts for making security decisions.  Using these decision models, we believe that anyone can make better security decisions and that the information shared can be used to keep everyone up to date as the security landscape changes.
